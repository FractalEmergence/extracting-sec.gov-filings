## Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using pyqt5.

The image below is a screenshot of the GUI. In the current state, the GUI is not optimized and may contain some bugs as it has not yet undergone proper testing. Run main_ui.py with all of the files in the same folder. Additionally, we can create a stand-alone executeable using Pyinstaller. I recommend using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Auto PY to EXE"</a>, which is a graphical interface for Pyinstaller. You can also download the stand-alone version that I made at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LHybF1QZj6yJ0NPqSG0PJ5nOyCxXLJ89/view?usp=sharing.
